# The Partnersense fullstack code test

Welcome and good luck to you!

## Scope
Try to spend aproxiomitly four hours on the test.

We will of corse look at your code, but the most important for us is to undertand how you aproach problems, how you structure your work, what you find hard and what you find easy.

We don't expect a finnished solution after these four hours you will spend on this code but rather this four hours is a good time for you to get familliar with the code and solution to get a good enough understanding of the solution to be able to have a discussion with us regarding the pros and cons of this solution and of code in general.

## Language, Frameworks and libs
The code test is a javascript based test, but you will get bonus points if you start to refactor it to typeScript.

### NEXT JS
Built with Next js. Next js is an open-source development framework built on top of Node. js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites.
https://nextjs.org/

### Tailwind
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
https://tailwindcss.com/

### React-use-cart
"react-use-cart is a lightweight shopping cart hook for React, Next. js, and Gatsby. Create persistent carts with local storage, or your own adaptor. react-use-cart supports flexible cart item schemas, multiple carts per page and offers cart handlers that let you trigger actions on item add, update or remove.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-cart

## Prerequisite
Download and install node.
https://nodejs.org/en/


## Download the repo and start the solution
Download the Repo

Open the Repo in a comand prompt / terminal and go to the codetest folder and run.

`npm i`

and then.

`npm rund dev`

Now your solution shold have built and started in a browser.

## The assignment
The scenario is that we have started on a new e-commerce solution and we are several developers working on the solution at the same time. We did start with the frontend and almost all frontend is done and you shouldnÂ´t need to spend to much time on frontend.

But in the initial steps that have bean done some mock data have bean used to create the pages either hard coded in the markup or as a local array in the pages. Now a friendly developer have setup some more proper products in the data/constants.js file and several of the components and pages are using this data, this file is the one you should use for product information changes if needed.

Another developer have implemented the react-use-cart hook and have started implementing real cart functionality that ads products to the cart from the PDP.js (Product details page) to the cart and shows the cart items amount in the header.

Now it's your time to make the cart page mor dynamic. For now the cart page is just markup and all markup is directly placed in the page /pages/cart.js

Your assignment is to:
- Split up the /pages/cart.js to instead use components.
- Implement the react-use-cart in this page / components as well
- Instead of listing mock data pleas list the items from in react-use-cart instad
- Add funcitonality to remove cart item rows
- Add funcitonality to change the cart item amounts
- Add funcitonality to se the cart item rows total cost
- Add funcitonality to se the entire carts sub total cost
- Add funcitonality to clear the cart when you click the Checkout button and redirect to the startpage

### Tips and Hints
Remember that you only nead to spend four hours on this and that It's not your code that will be the deciding factor for us but rather our discussions regarding the solution and code and your ability to aproach situations like this one.

Start small! In our opinion It's better to have something that works (One product or one attribute) and focus on the process and flow rather than everything is perfect from the begining. 

We promot to itterate our solutions and help each other with the itterations so often our first lines of code in our solutions are just the staring point and could be sean more as POC (Proof of concept) rather then production ready code.
